# Sprint Challenge: SQL

Design a database for an online chat system.

## Deliverables

Add a file called `queries.sql` that runs all of the `CREATE TABLE`,
`INSERT`, and `SELECT` queries, below.

The last question is a fill-in-the-blank. You can add that as a SQL
comment to the end of `queries.sql`.

## Details

The chat system has an arbitrary number of:

* Organizations (e.g. `Lambda School`)
* Channels (e.g. `#random`)
* Users (e.g. `Dave`)

The following relationships exist:

* An organization can have many channels.
* A channel can belong to one organization.
* A channel can have many users subscribed.
* A user can be subscribed to many channels.
* Additionally, a user can post messages to a channel. (Note that a user might have
posted messages to a channel to which they subscribed in the past, but they no
longer subscribe to now.)

> In the following, there will be more columns that you have to add in
> many tables, not just the ones listed here.

1. Write `CREATE TABLE` statements for tables `organization`, `channel`, `user`,
   and `message`.

   1. `organization`. This table should at least have column(s):
      * `name`

   2. `channel`. This table should at least have column(s):
      * `name`

   3. `user`. This table should at least have column(s):
      * `name`

   4. `message`. This table should have at least columns(s):

      * `post_time`--the timestamp of when the message was posted
        * See [Date types in
          SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#date_and_time_datatype).
          Also see the SQLite function `datetime()`.

      * `content`--the message content itself

2. Add additional foreign keys needed to the above tables, if any.

3. Add additional join tables needed, if any.

4. Write `INSERT` queries to add:

   For these `INSERT`s, it is OK to refer to users, channels, and organization
   by their `id`s. No need to do a subselect unless you want to.

   1. One organization, `Lambda School`
   2. Three users, `Alice`, `Bob`, and `Chris`
   3. Two channels, `#general` and `#random`
   4. 10 messages (at least one per user, and some in both channels).
   5. `Alice` should be in `#general` and `#random`.
   6. `Bob` should be in `#general`.
   7. `Chris` should be in `#random`.

5. Write `SELECT` queries to:

   For these `INSERT`s, it is **NOT** OK to refer to users, channels, and
   organization by their `id`s. You must join.

   1. List all organization `name`s.

   2. List all channel `name`s.

   3. List all channels in a specific organization by organization `name`.

   4. List all messages in a specific channel by channel `name` `#general` in
      order of `post_time`, descending. (Hint: `ORDER BY`. Because your
      `INSERT`s might have all taken place at the exact same time, this might
      not return meaningful results. But humor us with the `ORDER BY` anyway.)

   5. List all channels to which user `Alice` belongs.

   6. List all users that belong to channel `#general`.

   7. List all messages in all channels by user `Alice`.

   8. List all messages in `#random` by user `Bob`.

   9. List the count of messages across all channels per user. (Hint:
      `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`.)
      
      The title of the user's name column should be `User Name` and the title of
      the count column should be `Message Count`.

      The user names should be listed in reverse alphabetical order.
      
      Example:

      ```
      User Name   Message Count
      ----------  -------------
      Chris       4
      Bob         3
      Alice       3
      ```

   10. [Stretch!] List the count of messages per user per channel.

       Example:

       ```
       User        Channel     Message Count
       ----------  ----------  -------------
       Alice       #general    1
       Bob         #general    1
       Chris       #general    2
       Alice       #random     2
       Bob         #random     2
       Chris       #random     2
       ```

6. What SQL keywords or concept would you use if you wanted to automatically
   delete all messages by a user if that user were deleted from the `user`
   table?
